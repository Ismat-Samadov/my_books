# My Reading List Tracker ðŸ“š

A simple GitHub repository to track books I've read, am currently reading, or plan to read. This system provides a straightforward way to maintain a personal reading list using CSV format.

## Repository Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico

â””â”€â”€ reading-list.csv
```

## CSV Structure

The `reading-list.csv` file contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `book_name` | Title of the book |
| `author` | Author(s) of the book |
| `language` | Language the book is written in |
| `physically_exists` | Boolean indicating if you own a physical copy (true/false) |
| `status` | Reading status (to_read, in_progress, completed, abandoned) |
| `notes` | Your thoughts, quotes, or anything noteworthy about the book |

## Sample Data

```
book_name,author,language,physically_exists,status,notes
"Stratejik Pazarlama","Harvard Business Review Press",Turkish,true,completed,"interesting book for sales"
"HBR's 10 Must Reads on Managing People","Harvard Business Review Press",English,true,completed,"bullshit"

"HBR's 10 Must Reads on Making Smart Decisions","Harvard Business Review Press",English,true,completed,"bullshit"

## How to Use

### Adding a New Book

1. Visit the [Book Entry Form](https://yourusername.github.io/my_books/) (GitHub Pages)
2. Fill out the book details 
3. Click "Generate CSV Line"
4. Click "Copy to Clipboard"
5. Open `reading-list.csv` in your repository
6. Paste the line at the end of the file

### Manual Entry

You can also directly edit the `reading-list.csv` file by:

1. Opening or cloning the repository
2. Adding a new line to the CSV file with all required fields
3. Committing the changes

Example CSV entry:
```
"The Pragmatic Programmer","Andrew Hunt, David Thomas",English,true,completed,"Great book on software craftsmanship"
```

## Format Guidelines

- Wrap text fields that might contain commas in double quotes
- Escape double quotes within fields by doubling them
- Use lowercase for status values: to_read, in_progress, completed, abandoned

## Status Meanings

- `to_read`: Books you plan to read
- `in_progress`: Books you're currently reading
- `completed`: Books you've finished reading
- `abandoned`: Books you started but decided not to finish

## Book Entry Form

I've created a simple HTML form to help generate properly formatted CSV lines. The form is included directly in the repository as `index.html` and can be accessed via GitHub Pages at:

https://yourusername.github.io/my_books/

The form includes:
- Required fields validation
- Auto-generation of properly escaped CSV
- Language selection (English, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Russian)
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Dark mode interface

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Automated statistics about reading habits
- Data visualization of reading progress
- Integration with external book APIs
- Reading goal tracking
